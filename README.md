I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science, and I absolutely adore everything about technology and IT. From web design using HTML and CSS to diving into programming languages like C, I find immense joy in exploring the endless possibilities of the digital realm. As a junior in the field, I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and grow as a professional. Feel free to explore my humble projects and get to know more about my passion for all things tech!
